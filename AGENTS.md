# AGENTS.md — OpenCrypto Accelerator (OCA)

Open-source FPGA crypto accelerator. Canonical project specification:
`SPEC.md` (read it first — it drives all phase work).
MVP development BOM: `BOM-MVP.md`.

## Project shape

- **Phase 1 (done)**: abstract crypto API in C11 + OpenSSL 3 software
  backend + official test vectors + benchmarks. In `oca/`.
- **Phase 2 (in progress)**: FPGA cores in SystemVerilog, verified with
  cocotb + Verilator against the same official vectors. In `oca/hw/`.
- **MVP target**: Lattice ECP5 (Colorlight i9 v7.2) + GbE, open toolchain
  (yosys/nextpnr-ecp5). PCIe phase later: Artix-7 + LitePCIe (Vivado is
  the documented exception to the open-toolchain rule).
- Linux/WireGuard integration via kernel crypto API — **no kernel
  patches**. FreeBSD if_wg needs a minimal patch or is out of scope v1.

## Environment rules

- **No system-wide installs without explicit permission.** Everything
  lives under this directory (`tools/`, `oca/.venv/`).
- Developed on CachyOS with Python 3.14. cocotb PyPI releases (<= 2.0.1)
  reject Python >= 3.14, so cocotb is installed from git master:
  `oca/.venv/bin/pip install "git+https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb.git@master"`
- To rebuild Verilator: clone `verilator/verilator` branch `stable`,
  `autoconf && ./configure --prefix=$PWD/../../tools/verilator` with
  `help2man` from `tools/help2man` in PATH, `make -j && make install`.
- To rebuild the ECP5 toolchain (sources in `tools/src/`, all installed
  with `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=tools/<name>`):
  - Eigen 3.4.0 — header-only, `cmake --install` into `tools/eigen`;
  - prjtrellis — cmake on `libtrellis/`; `pytrellis` builds against
    Python 3.14 with the bundled pybind11;
  - yosys — CMake (not the old Makefile), Ninja, submodules included
    (`abc`, `slang`);
  - nextpnr — `-DARCH=ecp5 -DECP5_DEVICES=45k -DBUILD_PYTHON=OFF
    -DTRELLIS_INSTALL_PREFIX=tools/trellis
    -DEigen3_DIR=tools/eigen/share/eigen3/cmake`. Building only the 45k
    chipdb keeps the build short; add devices when other boards appear.
- System dependencies used as-is (already present on the dev machine, no
  installs performed): boost 1.91 (incl. `libboost_python314`), tcl 8.6,
  readline, libffi, zlib.

## How to build and test

Software (Phase 1), from `oca/`:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build          # 114/114 vectors must pass
./build/oca_bench               # benchmarks
```

RTL (Phase 2), from `oca/`:

```sh
.venv/bin/python hw/sim/run_chacha20.py           # 5/5 pass
.venv/bin/python hw/sim/run_poly1305.py           # 4/4 pass
.venv/bin/python hw/sim/run_chacha20_poly1305.py  # 7/7 pass
.venv/bin/python hw/sim/run_dirty_pad.py          # 2/2 pass
```

`run_dirty_pad.py` is separate from the official-vector suite on
purpose: it drives random garbage into the bytes past `in_len` instead
of zeros, and is the only test that can fail when the engine's padding
masking is wrong. The suite above zero-pads and passes with that masking
removed entirely.

Lint (must stay clean, `-Wall`):

```sh
../tools/verilator/bin/verilator --lint-only -Wall hw/rtl/*.sv --top-module chacha20_poly1305
```

ECP5 synthesis (Phase 2, from `oca/`), see `hw/syn/README.md`:

```sh
.venv/bin/python hw/syn/run_synth.py chacha20_poly1305   # ~2 min
```

## Hard rules

- **Test vectors are parsed from official sources in
  `tests/vectors/sources/` — never hand-typed expected values.**
  RFC hexdump pitfalls already hit twice: the ASCII gutter can start
  with hex-looking characters (cap at 16 bytes/line) and page breaks
  interrupt dumps. If a vector fails, suspect the parser before the
  implementation, and cross-check with an independent implementation
  (OpenSSL CLI / Python reference) before touching RTL.
- Licenses: software MIT/Apache-2.0, RTL CERN-OHL-P-2.0 (SPDX header in
  every file), hardware docs CERN-OHL-P v2.
- yosys reads these cores with `read_slang`, not `read_verilog -sv`:
  the Verilog-2005 frontend rejects functions with `return` and
  concatenation assignments, which the RTL uses throughout.
- cocotb gotchas: runner import is `cocotb_tools.runner` on cocotb 2.x
  (fallback from `cocotb.runner`); when polling a DUT status signal in
  a loop, `await RisingEdge` **before** reading — reading right after
  the edge that consumed your stimulus returns the stale value.
- **An AXI-Stream driver samples the handshake before the transfer
  edge, not after it**: `await ReadOnly()`, read `tready`, then
  `await RisingEdge` — and only advance to the next byte if `tready`
  was high, holding `tdata`/`tvalid`/`tlast` stable until it is.
  Polling `tready` after the edge reads what the slave offered
  *before* the transfer, which is the stale read above wearing a
  different hat, and RTL adapted to such a source grows a `tready`
  that outlives the state which consumes the byte: against a
  conforming master that silently drops one byte per packet, with
  nothing in simulation to show it. Cost the `s_tready` rework of
  2026-08-03.
- **Proposals from per-file analysis are not additive.** The area pass
  of 2026-08-03 came out of a workflow that read the three RTL files
  independently, and two of its proposals — an early `blk_ready` in
  `poly1305.sv`, a combinational `p_blk` in the wrapper — were each
  correct against the file their author had read and silently corrupted
  the authentication tag when combined: both attacked the same one-cycle
  handshake bubble, each assuming the *other* side kept its signal
  registered. Per-file review cannot see this by construction, and the
  official-vector suite is not a safety net for a data-dependent
  handshake failure. Before applying two proposals that touch opposite
  ends of one handshake, measure the combination; never infer it from
  the parts.
- When mutating a Python model or testbench to prove a test can fail,
  delete `hw/sim/__pycache__` before re-running. Python invalidates its
  cache on mtime and size at one-second granularity, so a same-size edit
  reverted within the same second keeps executing the mutated bytecode —
  the restore looks broken, or worse, a later run silently keeps the
  mutation. Cost one confusing debug session on 2026-08-03.
- Git: work on branches; never commit directly on the default branch.

## Current status

- Phase 1: done, 114/114 vectors pass, zero warnings. Baseline on the
  dev machine: AES-128-GCM 26.6 GB/s (AES-NI), ChaCha20-Poly1305
  5.9 GB/s (large blocks).
- Phase 2: `chacha20.sv`, `poly1305.sv`, `chacha20_poly1305.sv` (AEAD,
  encrypt + decrypt) written and verified against RFC 8439 vectors
  (2.3.2, 2.4.2, 2.5.2, A.3 #1-4, 2.8.2, A.5). Lint `-Wall` clean.
  All three have a reference model validated on the official vectors
  before it is trusted: ChaCha20 with 100 randomised blocks (counter
  randomised over its full 32 bits), Poly1305 with digit-boundary edge
  cases and 200 randomised messages, the AEAD engine with 40 randomised
  encryptions and 40 randomised decryptions over AAD and message lengths
  chosen around the 64-byte block and 16-byte MAC boundaries.
- Open ECP5 toolchain built locally (yosys, prjtrellis, nextpnr-ecp5).
  Baseline synthesis of the AEAD engine on the LFE5U-45F was 25% of the
  LUTs, **90% of the multipliers**, Fmax **26.77 MHz**, critical path in
  the single-cycle 130x130 multiply of `poly1305.sv`.
- `poly1305.sv` reworked into a 26-bit limb datapath (five digits, the
  mod-2^130-5 reduction folded into the accumulation, parameter
  `ROWS_PER_CYCLE`). Result: the AEAD engine drops from **65 to 20**
  multipliers (90% -> 28%) and standalone Poly1305 Fmax more than
  doubles (22.94 -> **52.68 MHz**). **AEAD Fmax was unchanged**
  (26.77 -> 26.10 MHz, inside place & route noise) and throughput fell
  ~40% to ~0.28 Gbps — a 64-byte block costs 47 cycles instead of 29,
  measured in simulation — because a Poly1305 block now takes 9 cycles
  instead of 3 and the critical path moved into `chacha20.sv`
  (`oca/hw/syn/README.md`).
- `chacha20.sv` reworked to compute one round per cycle (parameter
  `ROUNDS_PER_CYCLE`, 22 cycles per block instead of 12). Result:
  standalone Fmax 28.66 -> **53.11 MHz** (+85%), level with Poly1305's
  52.68 MHz, and **AEAD Fmax 26.10 -> 37.87 MHz** (+41% over the
  baseline), for +799 LUTs standalone / +487 in the engine and one
  flip-flop. A 64-byte block now costs **57 cycles** (measured), so
  throughput is **~0.34 Gbps**: above the ~0.28 Gbps of the previous
  state, still **28% below the ~0.47 Gbps baseline** — Fmax gained 41%
  while cycles per block grew 97% across the two reworks.
- The wrapper's byte mask in `chacha20_poly1305.sv` then stopped building
  itself with `(512'd1 << (len * 8)) - 512'd1` — one 512-bit carry chain,
  which had become the critical path — and builds it per byte instead,
  64 independent 7-bit compares. **AEAD Fmax 37.87 -> 50.08 MHz** (+32%)
  for +514 LUTs, cycles unchanged, so throughput reaches **~0.45 Gbps**:
  level with the ~0.47 Gbps baseline, on 20 multipliers instead of 65
  and at nearly twice the clock. The critical path is back inside
  `chacha20.sv` (one quarter round, 19.97 ns), where the engine is now
  within 6% of the standalone core.
- The AEAD FSM was then split in two, joined by a one-block buffer, so
  the phases overlap: the input FSM accepts a block, runs ChaCha20 and
  emits ciphertext while the MAC FSM drains the buffer into Poly1305, and
  block N is authenticated while block N+1 is encrypted. A 64-byte block
  costs **40 cycles instead of 57** (measured), for **-540 LUTs** and
  **+13 flip-flops** — area went down, because the buffer replaces the
  old `src` register one for one and the 512-bit multiplexer in front of
  it loses one source. AEAD Fmax 50.08 -> 52.58 MHz is +5%, inside the
  place & route noise band, as it must be: the netlist's carry chains are
  unchanged and the critical path is still the one quarter round inside
  `chacha20.sv` (19.02 ns), now within 1% of that core standalone.
  Throughput **~0.67 Gbps: +50% on the previous state and +42% on the
  ~0.47 Gbps original baseline**, on 20 multipliers instead of 65. This
  is the first point in the series where the engine is faster than where
  it started.
- The 40 cycles are the MAC FSM alone: 4 sub-blocks x (9 Poly1305 cycles
  + 1 for the registered `p_blk` handshake). ChaCha20's 22 cycles are
  fully hidden — proved rather than assumed, by measuring an AAD block,
  which never runs ChaCha20 and costs exactly the same 40 cycles.
- An **area pass** then took the engine from **10041 to 7358 LUTs
  (-26.7%)** with flip-flops (5738), multipliers (20) and cycles per
  block (40, measured differentially: 227 cycles for 4 blocks, 387 for 8)
  all unchanged. Two independent changes: `chacha20.sv` carries **one**
  round datapath instead of two — a diagonal round is a column round on a
  row-rotated state and rotating by a constant is wiring, so 16 of the 32
  adders and the multiplexer choosing between them are deleted (4368 ->
  3125 standalone, exactly -256 CCU2C) — and `chacha20_poly1305.sv` masks
  the padding on the 16-byte sub-block Poly1305 reads instead of on the
  512-bit buses feeding it, replacing two full-width masking stages with
  one quarter-width one (-1454 LUTs). **No speed is claimed**, and one
  seed could not settle whether any was there: over seeds 1-4 the engine
  means 50.72 -> 52.83 MHz (+4.2%) while the standalone core shows no
  effect at all (51.50 -> 52.76, distributions overlapping). The critical
  path is structurally the same quarter round inside `chacha20.sv`, so
  the engine's separation is recorded as a plausible congestion effect
  and kept out of the throughput figures. The masking change is covered
  by `hw/sim/test_dirty_pad.py`, without which no test in the project
  could see it (`oca/hw/syn/README.md`).
- Next: **replicate the engine.** At 20 multipliers and 7358 LUTs each,
  an LFE5U-45F holds three — 60/72 multipliers (83%), 22074/43848 LUTs
  (50.3%) — for **1.97-2.07 Gbps** aggregate over four seeds, which
  straddles the >= 2 Gbps the MVP target is written against, exactly as
  the previous state did. A fourth is still out of reach on
  multipliers alone (80 > 72) and the area pass did not change that; on
  LUTs alone four would now fit (67.1%), so **the multiplier budget is
  now the binding constraint on engine count**, where before the pass the
  LUT budget was the likelier one. The 50.3% is out-of-context and still
  has to absorb the GbE MAC, the host interface and packet buffering, so
  it is a floor for three engines, not a budget for the board. Note that
  `ROWS_PER_CYCLE` in `poly1305.sv` competes with replication for the
  same 72 multipliers — 2 rows per cycle costs 40 per engine, so one
  engine instead of three — while removing the one-cycle `p_blk` bubble
  is free. Then the streaming/packet interface toward the GbE MVP.
